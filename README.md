# CSCI1113game
this game is adapted from a base code provided by UMN CSCI 1113 lab. The base code is included in the repository as version 0.0. The game is written in c++.

The aim of this project for me is to advance my use of classes and inheritance. It will be a text based game which displays a game board. The game will respond to game board state such that new enemies or loot drops will spawn depending on the game board state.
